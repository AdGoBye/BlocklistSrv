# This is really bad practice but the [REMOVED] at InfluxDB don't provide a way for us to create a token with our own
# value, which we could have otherwise used to make more minimal secrets.
#
# Since Docker doesn't have a mechanism for passing secrets between containers short of doing it ourselves per volumes,
# we'll use the admin secrets as the only secret we can provision and use it for Grafana and BlocklistSrv.
# Fix this as soon as https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/23592 is fixed
